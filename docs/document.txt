As I was creating the test directory, I found out that the idea of creating an init file was neccessary. 
so I am creating an init file for all the directories and also in the main depository

I am adding an init file in the depository in the capstone-tps25 directory


Created a test 


I changed my repository name in GitHub and used "git remote -v" to check the current depository url and updated it with  "git remote set-url orgin <new-repo-url>".
With this I will fetch and push to the actual depository. Once I updated the url in my local repo I also updated the name in my local repo


Create a config.py file for storing the API keys
    took the three steps of add, commit, and push to my depository.


Create a data directory
Create a screenshots directory
create a requirements file
Create a docs folder or directory
Create a week11_reflection.md file

write reflection for week 11

add weather application class with basic weather API setup 
It includes constructor with API key, base URL, and default timeout.
Lays foundation for future weather data functionality

Add WeatherProcessor class with Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion
includes a method to convert temperature from celsius to Fahrenheit.
Prepared for future weather data processing extensions.

Add WeatherStorage class to save city temperature data to file
Includes a meathod to append city and temperature data to 'data.txt'.
Sets up basic persistence for weather information.

Define public API with WeatherAPI, WeatherProcessor, and WeatherStorage

Initialize a Tkinter window 
    - Sets the title to "Weather Dashboard"
    - Sets the window size to 400x300

commit message for API file:
    refactor(api): convert WeatherAPI to use dataclass and improve structure

after recovering the lost files i aborted a base that caused me to loose the actual api contructed file
this above commit is actually a remake of the orginal i had there.

initiated the storage file:

why write Tests
-- Simulate possible edge cases

-- catch & Track Breaking Changes
    when start working with an app that has multiple parts 

 AI can write tests well
 There are great way of writing tests

Unit testing and integration testing
